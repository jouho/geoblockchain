# Geoblockchain Project

## Project Description

### Purpose
The motivation behind this project is to support vulnerable populations around the world. Vulnerable populations include, but not limited to, economically disadvantaged, racial and ethnic minorities, the uninsured, low-income children, the elderly, the homeless, those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and those with other chronic health conditions, including severe mental illness. It may also include rural residents, who often encounter barriers to accessing healthcare services. The vulnerability of these individuals is enhanced by race, ethnicity, age, sex, and factors such as income, insurance coverage (or lack thereof), and absence of a usual source of care. Their health and healthcare problems intersect with social factors, including housing, poverty, inadequate education, and geographical factors, such as access to locations and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to these populations and aims to provide a brand new method to address the vulnerability of such groups.

### Authors
The initial idea and design of this project is created by Bo Zhao, a geography professor at the University of Washington and the Pincipal Investigator at Humanistic GIS Laboratory. The initial development of the application is developed by Jou Ho, an undergraduate student at the University of Washington and a member of HGIS Lab.

### Goals
The goal of this project is to create a decentralized application (referred to as DApp) as opposed to typical applications where the backend code is running on centralized servers. This application allows users to donate cryptocurrency to any geographic regions that exist on the earth. This web-based platform will enable us to achieve the following primary goals:
- Visualize vulnerable population through the levels of donation different geographical region receives. This visualization is open for anyone to see, allowing other people to utilize for reference or any related studies.
- Provide a brand-new way to donate currency to vulnerable populations using blockchain  technology (explained in later sections), which allows us to create a donation application with the three critical following features, which introduces a more reliable and secured system architecture for donation purposes;
  1. **Immutability**: no one can alter the stored data nor change the program code for this application for malicious purposes.
  2. **Transparency**: every stored data, program code, and data processes are accessible for users to see, though immutable.
  3. **Traceability**: users can keep track of any transactions (explained later) made through the application.
- Ultimately, support the aforementioned vulnerable populations/geographies through the established donation platform.

### What is Blockchain and DApp

### Strengths and Weaknesses of Blockchain-based DApp

### Major Functions
The followings are the main functionalities of this DApp, although these are subject to change and new functions may be added in the course of development.

- A web map that allows users to navigate through different geographical regions.
- A search bar which users can type in the address, place, or country to find their location of interests.
- Users can post or create new call for donation by filling a registration form.
- Visualization of posted donations by markers on the map. The amount of donation could also be visualized by different levels of color.
- Pop up windows that shows up upon clicking on the markers. This window contains information about the donation post such as: the name of organization/individuals/population groups, description of the donation post (why do they need donation? who will be supported by the donation?), and the total amount of donation they already received, etc.
- Users can donate their crypto currency to a location by clicking on the "donate" button on pop up window for each donation post. They can decide how much cryptocurrency (Ether) to donate.
- A person who created the donation post can retrieve donated money to their cryptocurrency wallet (metamask)

Above are the main functions of this DApp. However, there are, and will be, functions and details that will be needed in the future development of this application. This includes:
- professional website design
- professional data visualizations
- functionalities that attracts large enough number of users
- security measures against malicious use of this applications
- improving overall user experience (UX) and user interface (UI)
