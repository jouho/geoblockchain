## Project Description

### Purpose
The motivation behind this project is to support vulnerable populations around the world. Vulnerable populations include, but not limited to, economically disadvantaged, racial and ethnic minorities, the uninsured, low-income children, the elderly, the homeless, those with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and those with other chronic health conditions, including severe mental illness. It may also include rural residents, who often encounter barriers to accessing healthcare services. The vulnerability of these individuals is enhanced by race, ethnicity, age, sex, and factors such as income, insurance coverage (or lack thereof), and absence of a usual source of care. Their health and healthcare problems intersect with social factors, including housing, poverty, inadequate education, and geographical factors, such as access to locations and environmental factors. This project is dedicated to these populations and aims to provide a brand new method to address the vulnerability of such groups.

### Goals
The goal of this project is to create a decentralized application (referred to as DApp) as opposed to typical applications where the backend code is running on centralized servers. This application allows users to donate cryptocurrency to any geographic regions that exist on the earth. This web-based platform will enable us to achieve the following primary goals:
- Visualize vulnerable population through the levels of donation different geographical region receives. This visualization is open for anyone to see, allowing other people to utilize for reference or any related studies.
- Provide a brand-new way to donate currency to vulnerable populations using blockchain technology, which allows us to create a donation application with the three critical following features, which introduces a more reliable and secured system architecture for donation purposes;
  1. Immutability: no one can alter the stored data nor change the program code for this application for malicious purposes.
  2. Transparency: every stored data, program code, and data processes are accessible for users to see, though immutable.
  3. Traceability: users can keep track of any transactions (explained later) made through the application.
- Ultimately, support the aforementioned vulnerable populations/geographies through the established donation platform.
